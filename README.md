# vlc-highlight_widgets
patch for VLC (by VideoLAN) that adds highlights to wideo widgets

By default, VLC has white video widgets (play/pause icons)
But they are unusable for light video scenes.

This patch makes it black with white highligts (like DMZ-black)


You can apply this patch by executing in VLC folder:
patch -p0 -i vlc_video_widgets_highlights.patch
